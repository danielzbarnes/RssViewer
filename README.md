# RssViewer
A Simple app that displays the items from an RSS feed.  I wrote it for myself so I can easily verify the status of an RSS feed I'm responsible for is updating every day.  I used it as an opportunity to play with Jetpack Compose.  LazyColumn is amazingly streamlined compared to RecyclerView.

This doesn't include a safety check on the connection status before doing the network call.  The network call generates lint warnings in Android Studio because the SDK thinks it as blocking the main thread for some reason.  Seems to be some issue with the SDK and how it analyzes code.  May try switching it over to Retrofit, even though that'd be overkill for what this is doing.
